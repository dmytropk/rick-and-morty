# Rick and Morty App

A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

App has been written using jQuery and uses the $.ajax function instead of fetch.

jQuery app contains same functionality as JavaScript app https://github.com/dmytropk/simple-pokemon (fetches data from an API and displays it in a modal with the name, an image, and another data attribute shown).

Bootstrap has been added to the jQuery project and is used for the buttons, modal, navbar, and list.

Repo includes an ".eslintrc" file and minified CSS and JS files.
